# Gronert's Horseshoe

Gronert's Horseshoe is a webapp used to keep 
track of and display statistics from a poker 
tournament. It keeps track of players, buy-ins,
and winnings. It allows a user with admin access 
to create new tournament sheets, create new players,
input buy-ins and winnings for those players, and 
send the results to the overall sheet displayed 
on the main page.

It was made with React, Semantic UI React, and
google-spreadsheet API.

## Lessons Learned

As my studies have mostly covered front end languages 
and technologies at this point, I have not had much 
experience using databases. With the google-spreadsheet 
API, I was able to have a database using google sheets. 
I feel a lot more comfortable using the 
google-spreadsheet API now. Also, I am very excited 
by the possibilities available to me when I 
dive into backend with Node.js and MongoDB.
